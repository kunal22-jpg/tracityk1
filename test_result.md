# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Implemented comprehensive enhancement to the data explorer. Fixed the core issue where only Andhra Pradesh data was showing by adding proper filtering and data retrieval for all 30 Indian states. Added advanced filtering by states, years, crime types, sorting options. Enhanced AI insights with context-aware analysis for each dataset type. Updated visualization to handle multi-state data intelligently. Backend now has new endpoints for metadata retrieval and filtered data. Frontend has complete filtering UI with multi-select capabilities. Ready for testing to verify all functionality works correctly across all datasets (crimes, covid_stats, aqi, literacy)."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of all backend API endpoints. All tests passed successfully. The enhanced API endpoints for filtered data retrieval, new endpoints for metadata and filtered data, updated visualization and insights endpoints, and enhanced AI insights with context-aware analysis are all working correctly. The system now properly supports filtering by states, years, and crime types across all collections (crimes, covid_stats, aqi, literacy). The metadata endpoint correctly returns all 30 Indian states, available years, and special filters like crime types for the crimes collection. The filtered data endpoint properly handles multiple states, multiple years, crime types filtering, and sorting. The enhanced AI insights provide detailed analysis with key findings, recommendations, comparison insights, and temporal analysis. All backend functionality is working as expected."

    message: "Completed testing of the TRACITY backend API. The API branding has been successfully updated - the root endpoint now returns 'TRACITY API - Your AI Data Companion' as expected. Most backend functionality is working correctly, including the stats endpoint, datasets endpoint, chat endpoint, metadata endpoint, filtered data endpoint, enhanced insights endpoint, and visualization endpoints. All endpoints properly support filtering by states, years, and crime types. The API successfully handles data for all 30 Indian states. There are a few minor issues: the covid_stats collection appears to be missing or empty, and the OpenAPI schema endpoint is not accessible. However, these don't affect the core functionality of the API. The backend is ready to support the new TRACITY dashboard and AI assistant."

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT PHASE

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix Data Explorer (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Step 1: Check Route Configuration
```javascript
// In App.js, verify the route is correctly configured:
<Route path="/explorer" element={<DataExplorer />} />
```

#### Step 2: Update DataExplorer Component
**File: `frontend/src/components/DataExplorer.js`**

**Required State Management**:
```javascript
const [metadata, setMetadata] = useState({});
const [selectedStates, setSelectedStates] = useState([]);
const [selectedYears, setSelectedYears] = useState([]);
const [selectedCrimeTypes, setSelectedCrimeTypes] = useState([]);
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('');
const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = useState('asc');
const [showAllStates, setShowAllStates] = useState(false);
const [isFiltering, setIsFiltering] = useState(false);
```

**Required UI Components**:
1. **Advanced Filtering Sidebar**:
   - Multi-select checkboxes for states (all 30 Indian states)
   - Year selection with grid layout
   - Crime type filtering for crimes dataset
   - Sort options with field selection and order

2. **Filter Status Display**:
   - Active filter summary badges
   - Record count display (filtered vs total)
   - Filter application status indicator

3. **Enhanced Insights Display**:
   - Key findings section
   - Recommendations panel
   - State comparison analysis
   - Temporal trend analysis

#### Step 3: API Integration Functions
**Required Functions**:
```javascript
const fetchMetadata = async (collectionName) => {
  // Fetch from /api/metadata/{collection_name}
};

const fetchFilteredData = async (filterRequest) => {
  // POST to /api/data/filtered
};

const handleStateToggle = (state) => {
  // Handle state selection
};

const handleYearToggle = (year) => {
  // Handle year selection
};

const clearAllFilters = () => {
  // Reset all filters
};
```

#### Step 4: Enhanced ChartComponent
**File: `frontend/src/components/ChartComponent.js`**

**Required Features**:
- Intelligent field selection based on dataset type
- Data grouping and aggregation for multi-state data
- Automatic sorting by values (descending order)
- Top 15 states display for better readability
- Enhanced color schemes with 15+ colors
